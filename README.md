# Tic Tac Toe Game – Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. One player chooses “X” and the other chooses “O”. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty spot on the grid. The objective is to be the first to form a straight line of three of their symbols, either:

Horizontally (three in a row)
Vertically (three in a column)
Diagonally (three across a diagonal)

# If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie (draw).
# 🎮 How It Works in the Program

The game board is represented as a list of 9 positions.
The user plays as “X” and the computer plays as “O”.
After each move, the program checks:
If any player has won.
If the game is tied (all spots filled).
The game continues until either:
A winner is declared, or
The game ends in a tie.
